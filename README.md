css best practices inspired by SMACSS

Two core goals:
1.  Increase the semantic value of a section of HTML and content
2.  Decrease the expectation of a specific HTML structure

Syntax
------

*  Indent: 4 spaces (no Tabs)
*  A Space behind the colon
*  Opening bracket on the same line as the rule set
*  Properties grouped by types: 1. Box, 2. Border, 3. Background, 4. Text, 5. Other

Categorizing
------------

There are four types of categories:
1.  Base: the defaults
2.  Layout: the sections of a page holding modules
3.  Module: the modular and reusable parts 
4.  State: different states of modules and layouts. Indicate a JavaScript dependency.

Naming Conventions
------------------

We want to know instantly just by its name what a selector is about und which category it belongs to:
*  Layouts: prefixed with "l-"
*  States: prefix layout and style names with "is-"
*  Modules: no prefix, but related elements and variations use their base modules name as prefix

Selectors
---------

Only include a selector that includes semantics.
Minimize the depth of applicability: The depth of applicability is the number of generations that are affected by a given rule. Minimize it to avoid too much dependency on a particular HTML structure, to improve maintenance, performance and readability.

Use:
*  Class: The selector of choice. For performance reasons use class selectors as the right most selector.
*  Child: Use child selectors to minimize the depth of applicability.

Avoid:
*  ID: ID selectors are not necessary for styling as the performance benefit compared to class selectors is nearly non-existent, but IDs make styling more complicated due to increasing specificity.
*  Element: Avoid element selectors because they are too generic when styles grow in complexity over time.
*  Tag: Avoid tag selectors for common elements for performance reasons.
